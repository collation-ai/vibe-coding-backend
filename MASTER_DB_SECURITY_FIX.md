# Master Database Security Fix

## Problem
Users were inadvertently being granted permissions to `master_db` (the database containing user credentials, API keys, and other sensitive system data) through the admin dashboard. This is a serious security issue as `master_db` should only be accessible to system administrators.

## Root Cause
The admin API endpoints did not have any validation to prevent granting permissions on `master_db`. Any database name could be specified when:
- Assigning databases to users
- Granting schema permissions
- Creating PostgreSQL users
- Granting table-level permissions
- Creating RLS policies

## Changes Made

### 1. API Admin Endpoints (`api/admin.py`)

Added security checks to prevent `master_db` access in the following endpoints:

#### Database Assignment (`POST /api/admin/database-assignments`)
- **Line 340-344**: Prevents assigning `master_db` to any user
- Returns HTTP 403 with clear error message

#### Schema Permissions (`POST /api/admin/permissions`)
- **Line 430-436**: Prevents granting schema permissions on `master_db`
- Returns HTTP 403 with clear error message

#### Table Permissions (`POST /api/admin/table-permissions`)
- **Line 680-685**: Prevents granting table permissions on `master_db`
- Returns HTTP 403 with clear error message

#### RLS Policies (`POST /api/admin/rls-policies`)
- **Line 784-789**: Prevents creating RLS policies on `master_db`
- Returns HTTP 403 with clear error message

### 2. PostgreSQL User Manager (`lib/pg_user_manager.py`)

#### Create PG User (`create_pg_user` method)
- **Line 108-114**: Added validation to prevent creating PostgreSQL users on `master_db`
- Raises `ValueError` with descriptive message

### 3. Cleanup Script (`scripts/cleanup_master_db_permissions.py`)

Created a comprehensive cleanup script that:
- Removes all schema permissions on `master_db`
- Removes all database assignments for `master_db`
- Marks PostgreSQL users on `master_db` as inactive
- Removes all table permissions on `master_db`
- Marks all RLS policies on `master_db` as inactive
- Provides a summary report of all actions taken
- Lists PostgreSQL users that need manual cleanup

## Security Validation

All checks are case-insensitive using `.lower()` comparison to prevent bypass attempts with variations like:
- `Master_Db`
- `MASTER_DB`
- `MaStEr_dB`

## Error Messages

All endpoints return consistent, informative error messages:
```
Cannot [action] on master_db. The master database contains sensitive system data and is reserved for administrative use only.
```

## How to Run Cleanup

To remove any existing `master_db` permissions that were granted before this fix:

```bash
cd /home/tanmais/vibe-coding-backend
python3 scripts/cleanup_master_db_permissions.py
```

The script will:
1. Show all master_db permissions that exist
2. Remove them from the database
3. Provide a summary report
4. List any PostgreSQL users that need manual cleanup

## Testing

After applying this fix, test that:

1. ✅ Cannot assign `master_db` through admin dashboard
2. ✅ Cannot grant schema permissions on `master_db`
3. ✅ Cannot create PostgreSQL users on `master_db`
4. ✅ Cannot grant table permissions on `master_db`
5. ✅ Cannot create RLS policies on `master_db`
6. ✅ All attempts return HTTP 403 with clear error message

## Files Modified

1. `/home/tanmais/vibe-coding-backend/api/admin.py`
2. `/home/tanmais/vibe-coding-backend/lib/pg_user_manager.py`

## Files Created

1. `/home/tanmais/vibe-coding-backend/scripts/cleanup_master_db_permissions.py`
2. `/home/tanmais/vibe-coding-backend/MASTER_DB_SECURITY_FIX.md` (this file)

## Recommendation

After running the cleanup script and verifying the fix:
1. Restart the server to apply changes
2. Run the cleanup script to remove existing master_db permissions
3. Test the admin dashboard to verify the restrictions are working
4. Consider adding database-level RLS policies on master_db for additional security layers

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. Whitelist of allowed database names per user role
2. Audit logging for permission grant attempts
3. Alerts when sensitive operations are attempted
4. Additional database name patterns to block (e.g., `*_admin`, `*_system`)
