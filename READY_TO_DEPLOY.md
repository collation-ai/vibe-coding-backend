# ✅ READY TO DEPLOY

## Fix Summary
The datetime serialization issue has been fixed and tested locally.

## What Was Fixed
- Changed `error_response.dict()` to `error_response.model_dump(mode="json")` in `/api/auth/validate.py`
- This fixes the "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable" error

## Local Test Results (PASSING)
```
✅ tanmais permissions: Shows master_db only
✅ freshwaterapiuser permissions: Shows cdb_written_976_poetry and master_db
✅ Query execution: Working for accessible databases
✅ Error handling: Returns proper JSON responses
```

## Commit Ready to Deploy
- Commit: `0065bf2` - "Fix datetime serialization: use model_dump(mode='json') instead of dict()"
- Branch: `vercel-update`
- Status: Ready to push

## To Deploy
```bash
# Push to trigger Azure deployment
git push origin vercel-update
```

## Test After Deployment
Once deployed to Azure (takes ~30 minutes), test with:
```bash
# Test via gateway
curl -X GET "https://vibe-auth-gateway.azurewebsites.net/api/proxy/api/auth/permissions" \
  -H "Cookie: vibe_session=[SESSION-ID]" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: [CSRF-TOKEN]"
```

## Local Testing (Before Deployment)
You can continue testing locally with:
```bash
python3 test-local-code.py
```

This connects to the REAL database and runs the exact code that will be deployed.
